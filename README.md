# legal-aid
A web app for law firms built with Ruby on Rails

Plan of attack:

Setup Devise
Setup Pundit
Validations?
Validation errors displayed on view(see requirements)
Deal with nested routes for users and cases
Setup models and routes for notes

modify/create forms for creating cases needs to assign attorney and have the abilty to create a new attorney if the one you want assigned doesnt already exhist(this is where you should use a join model! and nested form)

also need a form to assign a user to a case(only admin)
make forms for notes

the join models here arent great for the nest form...think maybe...courthouse_id | case_id

courthouse attr civil or supreme, address, ??



Roadmap:

NEED to add and set up pundit for roles and scopes. [user, attorney, admin]

clients/:id/cases/:id
  #the lawyer routes should only be accessable to the lawyer being identified and to the admins

  cases have_many "notes"(which is like comments on a blog post)
  notes belong to a case

  any user can leave a note
  only the owner of the note may edit it
  owners and admins can delete notes

  a user has_many notes
  notes belong to a user
  cases have many notes
  note belongs to a case

  note_table => 

  note_id(primary) user_id case_id note_content

  a case has_many users, through case_users
  a user has many cases, through case_users

  case_users case_id:integer user_id:integer

<!--   a client has many cases
  cases belong to a client -->
  a lawyer has many clients through cases <!-- this might need to be a user, where you use the roles for access to lawyers -->

  the nested form can be used to set up a new case where the nested resource is the the client

  lawyer crud (only admin may delete)
  case crud (only admins may delete, only users assigned to the case can edit)
