# legal-aid
A web app for law firms built with Ruby on Rails

todo:

change names for presentation

owners and admins can delete notes => this is working but not with authorize @record. not sure why?


maybe: 

Think about css?(edit responsive css as well) => fine for now, but would need polishing for production.
add search for cases(index and caption) and clients(someday)
add fee schedule calc(someday)
